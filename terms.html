<span>2.2</span> No Commercial Activity and Status of Go College<br>

The Application and the Services are strictly limited to providing a Service for Car Owners and Co-Travelers to car share in a private capacity. The Services may not be used to offer or accept car sharing for hire or reward or for profit or in any commercial or professional context. The Services may be used only to offer or accept car sharing in exchange for sharing the cost of the Trip between the Car Owner and the Co-Traveler.<br>

Car Owners agree not to obtain any hire or reward or make profit in any form, from any Trip. The Service and the Cost Contribution may only be used to discharge the Car Owner’s costs and may not be used to generate any hiring charges or reward or profit in any form for the Car Owner. The Car Owner is not entitled to make profit by virtue of the amount of the Cost Contribution, the types of Trips offered by a Car Owner, the frequency of such Trips or the number of Co-Travelers transported. This applies to all activities, arrangements and Services booked using the Application and any additional services or activities which may be agreed between Car Owner and Co-Traveler through the Application.<br>

The Car Owner must not provide any additional services to the Co-Traveler in exchange for hiring charges or any reward or for profit or otherwise (and the Co-Traveler may not accept or ask for any such services) including (without limitation) package delivery, waiting time, additional drop offs and pick-ups and collecting additional passengers (other than the Co-Traveler).<br>

All Trips, collection points and destinations must be pre-agreed through the Application between the Car Owner and Co-Traveler. Car Owners may not collect any Co-Travelers from any location which has not been pre-agreed with the Co-Traveler through the Application.<br>

Members are reminded that using the Services and offering Trips for hire or reward or in a commercial or professional capacity may invalidate a Car Owner’s insurance and invite adverse legal actions by the road transport authorities. Go College shall not be in for any loss or damage incurred by a Member as a result of any or breach by a Member of these Conditions including where any Car Owner (in breach of these terms) offers Services through the Application in a professional or commercial capacity (thereby potentially invalidating their insurance) and breach of any agreement between the Car Owner and the Co-Traveler. Any offering of Trips in violation of the Conditions shall be at the sole risk such Member and Go College shall have no liability towards Members for such violations.<br>

Status of Go College<br>

Neither Go College nor the Application provides any transport services. The Application is a communications platform for Members to transact with one another. Go College does not interfere with Trips, destinations or timings. The agreement for car sharing is between the Car Owner and the Co-Traveler. Go College is not a party to any agreement or transaction between Members, nor is Go College liable in respect of any matter arising which relates to a booking between Members. Go College is not and will not act as an agent for any Member.<br>

Any breach of these Conditions will give rise to immediate suspension of such Member’s User Account and they may be restricted from accessing any further Services.<br>

<span>2.3</span> Types of Booking and Payment<br>

Go College offers to its Members an online booking service with a view to facilitate the booking of seats by Passengers.<br>

Go College reserves the right not to offer the Booking Service to a Trip o due to: (i) changes to applicable law, changes in the practice of regulatory authorities or changes in case law, (ii) changes to market practices or technology changes, (iii) changes of business considerations underlying the Booking Services, and (iv) other important and valid reasons.<br>

Go College reserves the right to limit the number and/or class of Members eligible to the Booking Service for any Trip.<br>

2. How to book a Car-Sharing for a Trip: The Car Owner provides details of his or her Trip on the Application, specifying date and time for departure and destination points, the amount of the Cost Contribution per seat and all other relevant travel conditions.<br>

The Passenger books one or more seats in the car for that Trip from the Application.<br>

Members accept that given the nature of the service Car Owners and Co-Travelers will have no recourse to Go College for any aspect of the transaction including in relation to cancellation, last minute changes, failure by the Car Owner or the Co-Traveler to turn up or non-payment of the Cost Contribution. In particular it is the Car Owner’s responsibility to collect payment from the Co-Traveler at the time of the Trip.<br>

Go College will not contact either party and will take no other steps whatsoever than those described above to manage the booking. The operation of the Trip is solely managed by the respective Car Owner and Co-Traveler(s).<br>

Please note that Go College reserves the right to change any aspect of the Application or the Service which may include adding new services (which may require payment) or withdrawing any existing Services. Go College does not guarantee that the Application will be functional at all times and Services may be suspended during such period when the Application is not in operation. Go College will not be liable to any of the Members in case where the Application is non-operational.<br>

<span>2.4</span> Car Owner and Co-Traveler Obligations<br>

Car Owner’s obligations<br>

The Car Owner agrees:<br>

That the Trip shall not be for any fraudulent, unlawful or criminal activity.<br>

That they will procure for the Vehicle, a comprehensive insurance policy, which provides insurance cover to the occupants in the Vehicle and covers third party liability.<br>

That they will present themselves on time and at the place agreed with the specified Vehicle;<br>

That they will immediately inform all Co-Travelers of any change whatsoever to the Trip. If one or more Co-Travelers have made a booking and the Car Owner decides to change any aspect of the Trip, the Car Owner undertakes to contact all Co-Travelers who have made a booking in relation to that Trip and to obtain the agreement of all Co-Travelers to the change. If a Co-Traveler refuses the change, they are entitled to a full refund and without any compensation being paid to the Car Owner.<br>

The Car Owner must comply with the Good Conduct Charter at all times.<br>

The Car Owner must wait for the Co-Traveler at the pickup point for at least 30 minutes after the agreed time (however, the Co-Traveler is expected to be punctual).<br>

Co-Traveler obligations<br>

The Co-Traveler agrees:<br>

That the Trip shall not be for any fraudulent, unlawful or criminal activity.<br>

That they will present themselves on time and at the place agreed with the Car Owner;<br>

That they will immediately inform the Car Owner or Go College if they are required to cancel a Trip.<br>

That they will comply with the Good Conduct Charter at all times.<br>

The Co-Traveler agrees to wait at the pickup point for at least 30 minutes after the agreed time for the Car Owner to arrive.<br>

That they will pay the Cost Contribution to the Car Owner.<br>

If the Co-Traveler or Car Owner fail to comply with any of these terms or any other Conditions Go College reserves the right to keep information relating to the breach, to publish or disclose this information on the Member’s online profile and to suspend or withdraw the Member’s access to the Application.<br>

That they shall ensure that all other persons who accompany the Co-Traveller in the Trip comply with these Conditions as applicable to a Co-Traveller.<br>

<span>2.5</span> Insurance<br>

The Car Owner agrees and undertakes to take out and maintain a comprehensive insurance to cover third party liability, the occupants of the Vehicle and the Trip offered or booked through the Application. The Car Owner agrees that they will, on request, provide the Co-Traveler with evidence, in advance of the Trip, of the complete validity of its insurance policy. The Car Owner also undertakes to hold a valid driving licence and that the Car Owner will own or will be entitled to use the Vehicle and that the Vehicle will have a valid PUC (Pollution Under Control) certificate and the Co-Traveler is entitled to request evidence of the Car Owner’s insurance, registration certificate (‘log book’), driving licence and PUC certificate at any time up to completion of the Trip.<br>

It is Go College’s understanding that governmental authorities take the view that a Co-Traveler who contributes only towards travel expenses is treated as travelling without hire or reward to the driver, and is therefore a third party passenger who is covered by comprehensive third party insurance policy in India. However Go College gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Car Owner’s responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover.<br>

It is up to each Car Owner and Co-Traveler to confirm with each other that the Car Owner is covered by valid insurance. The Car Owner must confirm that their insurance policy allows them to carry Co-Travelers and that their insurance policy covers all Co-Travelers and any accident or incident which may occur during a Trip.<br>

The Car Owner and the Co-Traveler are aware that standard non-commercial insurance policies may refuse to cover loss or damage arising in the event that the Car Owner had made or was seeking to make a profit.<br>

The Car Owner may collect no payment from the Co-Traveler other than the Cost Contribution and the Car Owner must not in any event provide Vehicle on hire or for reward in any form.<br>

The Car Owner therefore undertakes to calculate their expenses (fuel, toll, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and insurance of their vehicle) and guarantees that the total Cost Contributions requested from their Co-Travelers does not result in the Vehicle running for hire or for reward.<br>

If the Car Owner does receive any hiring charges or reward, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Trip for any other reason, the Car Owner will be responsible for the financial consequences, losses and damages arising and Go College will not be liable under any circumstances to the Car Owner or the Co-Traveler.<br>

Go College reserves the right, but not the obligation at its own discretion, to suspend immediately the account of a user including the money displayed and to make aware to competent authorities any professional activity.<br>

<span>2.6</span> Management of Disputes Between Members<br>

Go College may at its sole discretion provide its Members with an online service for resolving disputes. This service is non-binding. Go College is under no obligation to seek to resolve disputes and this service is offered at Go College’s sole discretion and may be withdrawn at any time.<br>

<span>2.7</span> Verification of IDs and Phone number<br>

By accepting the terms and conditions contained herein, every Member or any person who wishes to register as a Member hereby agrees and consents to the fact that Go College may collect IDs / documents belonging to them including but not limited to passport, PAN card and Aadhaar card for the purpose of verification of the information contained in such IDs / documents by third party service providers.<br>

<span>2.8</span> Contacting Members<br>

By accepting the terms and conditions contained herein, every Member hereby agrees and gives consent to Go College to communicate via phone calls, sms, email and such other means as Go College may deem fit. Such communications to Members may be recorded through technical support provided by third parties for the purpose of training, quality and for regularly updating the Members about the services of Go College.<br>

              <dt><span>3</span>DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</dt>
              <dd>3.1 Members may access the Services on the Application at their own risk and using their best and prudent judgment before entering into any arrangements with other Members through the Application.

While Go College will take precautions to avoid inaccuracies in content of the Application, all content and information, are provided on an as is where is basis, without warranty of any kind. Go College does not implicitly or explicitly support or endorse any of the Members availing Services from the Application.<br>

3.3 Go College is not a party to any agreement between a Car Owner and Co-Traveler and will not be liable to either the Car Owner or the Co-Traveler unless the loss or damage incurred arises due to Go College’s negligence.<br>

3.4 Go College shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising as a result of:<br>

A false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete information being provided by a Member;<br>

Go College will not be liable to any Member in relation to any Trip unless Go College is notified of a claim relating to that Trip within 3 months of completion of the Trip<br>

Given that Car Owners are required to hold valid insurance to cover a Trip and given that Go College’s service is limited to putting Car Owners and Co-Travelers in touch with each other and cannot oversee any Trip, Members accept that the limitations on the Go College’s liability set out above are reasonable.<br>
